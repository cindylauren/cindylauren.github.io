Hey everyone, so I have been feeling very ambivalent on what to do about my future.  On one hand, I want to move to East Asia and experience another culture shock, live there, and learn the language .  On the other hand, I want to move to Paris, France. I want to study over there, learn to speak French, and be in a city that has a lot of fashion roots .  I live in New Jersey and I am working on moving to North Jersey or even New York City for the meantime.  One main reason is because I would like to be closer to my boyfriend Dan and I hope he can have a long distance relationship with me if I do move out of the country.  Secondly, I have aspirations that I want to fulfill like modeling.  I recently got a random email from Apple Models to go to NYC and bring outfits to wear so I need to figure out what outfits to buy. I am currently trying to sell my things like my desktop PC, furniture, clothes, and shoes to start the process of moving soon. Although, the only thing that has been preventing me from selling a lot of things online is that there is limit on how much I can list. This is going to be a longer process than I imagined.  Another thing, I have been meaning to change my legal last name because I am divorced and I do not identify with that last name.  I will be contacting pro bono lawyers soon.
