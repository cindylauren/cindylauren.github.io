I think traveling to East Asia would be a dream come true of mine. Having an opportunity to work and study in a field I am passion about will help me in the right path of my career which is something I am still having trouble with but I think the more I study, the career I truly want will narrow down. I'm interested in psychology and modeling. So a field of study in one of those categories would be great.
I would like to make a difference to help others in my community by sharing the knowledge that I have learned with them and studying will only help refine the information I give. I'm passionate about traveling to a country over there so I could learn a new language, be in a new culture, and hopefully live there for the rest of my life. I would like to be in China, South Korea or Japan (Japan has a large influence in American culture but so does China and South Korea) because I've met people from these countries and I have learned a lot from researching online and it has made me want to travel, study and live there. To live in China sounds like a nice experience to learn about Chinese eastern philosophy and their way of life and practices.  I think being there would make feel strange, like an outsider at first, but I think I will slowly adjust. Same feeling I have towards South Korea and Japan, too.  I love the beauty industry in South Korea so I think that's what originally intrigued me and I really like kdramas even though I've only seen two so far (still not finished with Run-On).  And now I have more of an inclination to want to travel to Japan after learning about ekiden running. 

Studying and finding a career over there sounds ideal because I want to settle in one of those countries. Also, I'll make sure that if I go, I won't give up on my hobbies like running and it would be cool to get into modeling over there. But I can't do everything at once and I need to start from somewhere. 

I still need to figure out my living situation here while unemployed.  I am selling things I don't need anymore and whatever is left, I will just send back to my parents house.  I might consider renting a room until the meantime so I can save money again and use it to go to one of those countries. I want to start working again so I have been applying, still, but not around the area that I am living at. 

I am still considering a European country, too, but it's really hard for me to choose where I would like to go because I am very indecisive. I am really unsure but I think what I will do is apply to a few schools from of each country I am interested in and see which is the best for me. 

As of two days ago, I am now single and Dan was the only thing that made me want to stay. It's nice because we are still friends, though and that is important to me because I really appreciate him. But, I think being in China sounds better and if not China, I will try another country. I like Hong Kong, Beijing and Shanghai. One of those three sound nice to live in and I want to stick with a main city.  

Yesterday, I was looking into doing volunteer work for Ukraine.  I would love to go over there and help out but I don't want to join the military because it isn't for me so I think I will donate instead.

One thing at a time!!!
