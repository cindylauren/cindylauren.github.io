A little update: 

I've been selling some of my personal belongings because I don't feel the need to have them anymore and since I am unemployed, I kind of need the money. I've been going to the library (not my local library but one that I really like that my boyfriend Dan showed me). I've been applying to a lot of places but so far, no luck.  I am trying to stay positive while I figure out what to do for work next while unemployed (this is my first time not having a job since 2013) and I plan to return to school either in the summer or fall semester. I plan on getting financial aid, a pell grant and, hopefully, an internship. Can you apply for all three?

I just found out the other day that my grandmother has been diagnosed with cancer in her stomach.  I feel really bad but she's okay, she says. I think I am just used to cancer in my family at this point that it isn't as devasting to hear now that I am older. It is also why I try to eat very clean and why I try to take care of my health. 

A few highlights this week for me have been the interactions while selling my belongings or going to different stores.  I feel like I need to be more social because the pandemic really isolated me.

Gas prices have been really high lately so I might cut back on driving although it is the first time I feel like I can get out and go places.  It's weird because I have been going out more but don't like driving but I also don't want to feel cooped up in my apartment, either.  I think I might have to start that again, though because it is getting expensive to drive around.  I am going to start looking to rent another room if I can't afford living here, preferably around the Jersey City area.  I've also been looking into getting a visa to travel/work/study in Hong Kong. It isn't my only option, though. I've just grown to prefer to study and work in a different country entirely now. I might just start sending the rest of my belongings to my parents.  Before I make that initiative to get a visa, I want to discuss to my boyfriend if he could handle a long-distance relationship and if not, I'll stay here and try harder to make things work out for the best for the both of us.

I've been running a lot lately and I just started the book, The Way of the Runner: A Journey Into the Fabled World of Japanese Running by Adharanand Finn. I am not that far into it but so far it's very interesting.  I never knew how serious Japanese people take running so it's kind of cool to dive in to a book like this.  I've also been catching up on anime and a kdrama called Run-On.  I had it queued for the longest time and I am just now watching it and it's really good! It makes me want to travel and run around Jeju Island.  I've also been doing yoga in the mornings to help with my stability and have incorporated some exercise routines that I've found on Youtube.

I've been feeling better lately than in the beginning of this year so I am grateful for that. Also, I figured out how to change my last name and I just need to call the Social Security Administration office! 

I plan to start using GitHub more but it is really confusing for me, still!  It's pretty cool to have my own website!

Bye bye, Adios, Au Revoir, Arriverderci, Annyeong, Sayonara, Zaijian etc. etc.! Okay, time to get off now. :)
