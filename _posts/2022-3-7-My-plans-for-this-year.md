title: My plans for this year
---

Good morning, for a new career path, I want to pursue a passion of mine in the fashion or entertainment industry.  I am currently looking into different opportunities within those fields to get my foot into that door.  I have decided to withdraw from my current college courses because none of my courses aligned with my interests. So, I have decided to wait until summer or fall semester if I don't happen to get an internship in a field that I am passion about. I plan on moving to North Jersey so I need to transfer my college credits over to another school which I have been actively looking into, as well. If things don't work out here for me, I plan to move to China.  I like the culture, people, and the cities over there seem like they are filled with opportunity and the mainland looks beautiful. I am considering other East Asian countries as well like South Korea or Japan which I am starting to apply for work within as well. This has just been what's on my mind as of lately.
