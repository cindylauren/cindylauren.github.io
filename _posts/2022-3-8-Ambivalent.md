Hey everyone, so I have been on the fence about what to do for my next career path. This is very far-fetched by the way but here it goes. On one hand, I want to move to East Asia and experience another culture shock, live there, and learn the language.  On the other hand, I want to move to Paris, France. I want to study over there, learn to speak French, and be in a city that has a lot of fashion roots. I never been to Europe so it would be a new and exciting experience for me. 

I live in New Jersey and I am working on moving closer to the city once my lease is up. One main reason is because I would like to be closer to my boyfriend Dan and I hope he can have a long distance relationship with me if I do move out of the country.  Secondly, I have aspirations that I want to fulfill like modeling. I received a random email from a model studio in NYC to get portraits taken so I need to figure out what outfits to wear. I am currently trying to sell my things like my desktop PC, furniture, clothes, and shoes to start the process of moving soon. I also feel the need to get out more while unemployed so I've been going to the library although I have good internet.

Another thing, I have been meaning to change my legal last name because I am divorced and I do not identify with that last name.  I'm going to start contacting pro bono lawyers while I'm unemployed after leaving a work environment that didn't align with me.

I'm also job hunting online, watching tv series that I've been meaning to catch up on, reading (I just finished the book, How To Not Die by Michael Greger, MD), and I'm maintaining my exercise routines to feel good.  

I'm starting to give myself the respect to take things one at a time and not feel so rushed to do it all.
